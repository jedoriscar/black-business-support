Whenever we talk about Businesses and companies in the United States, all the big businesses tend to be owned and controlled by whites and you will hardly find 1 owned by a black person. Anytime blacks in the US have tried to establish themselves throughout time, they‚Äôre always being suppressed, stopped, and silenced in 1 way or another. Despite being oppressed for as long as we can recall, the blacks have still not given up. They keep on fighting and striving to the extent that we now have black billionaires in the USA. They run multiple businesses and employ thousands of people too. In this video, we are going to be seeing the 20 biggest and Richest Black-owned Businesses in the United States Of America in 2022.

The cop questions him about the dumping, and claims that what he is doing is illegal. Mr. Whitfield assures the officer that he is in fact the owner of the business and dumping is obviously allowed on his own property. Nevertheless, the officer detains James and is intent on taking him to the station. Then when Mango Park Police Captain James Porter arrives on the scene, he sees the officer's true intentions and allows Mr. Whitfield to be released.

black entrepreneurship,gBgHRE8Qu7g,Closing the Wealth Gap: Felecia Hatcher Talks Black Ambition&#39;s Entrepreneurial Support,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBgHRE8Qu7g,"In this episode of EYL, hosts Troy Millings and Rashad Bilal are joined by the dynamic Felecia Hatcher, CEO of Black Ambition. Felecia dives deep into the transformative work Black Ambition is doing to support Black entrepreneurs by providing not just mentorship but the right kind of mentorship that opens doors and creates tangible opportunities for growth.

Troy kicks off the discussion by highlighting the phrase ‚Äúdon‚Äôt build in the dark‚Äù and emphasizes the value of mentorship in a startup‚Äôs journey. Felecia elaborates on how Black Ambition differentiates itself by ensuring mentors don't just advise but actively support entrepreneurs through their networks. She stresses the disservice caused by mentors who offer feedback but won't leverage their contacts for the mentees who need them. The goal, as she puts it, is to have mentors who are willing to put you on and get out of the way, allowing entrepreneurs to flourish with the right resources at their disposal.

The conversation then delves into how Black Ambition sets itself apart. Felecia shares that Black Ambition boasts a network of 50 mentors who have opened doors to giant retailers like HSN, Target, and Walmart. This is a direct reflection of the program‚Äôs mission to close the wealth gap through speed and efficiency, understanding that time is a commodity that Black entrepreneurs simply can‚Äôt afford to waste.

The dialogue takes an inspiring turn as Troy brings up the collaboration between Jay-Z and Pharrell, part of the rollout for Black Ambition. Felecia gives us an insight into how Pharrell's creativity and entrepreneurial spirit gave birth to the initiative. She shares a heartwarming account of Pharrell's journey from Virginia to becoming a mogul with a legacy that now supports 101 entrepreneurs through Black Ambition.

Rashad probes further, asking Felecia how she connected with Pharrell and how involved he is with Black Ambition. Felecia candidly shares her experiences, describing her first encounters with Pharrell and how he remains hands-on despite his busy schedule in Paris and his role at Louis Vuitton. One standout anecdote recalls a feminine hygiene company, Femly, which struggled for two years to get into Marriott hotels. Pharrell, leveraging his contacts, made two phone calls and got them an opportunity within those two locations, a testament to the impactful mentorship Black Ambition promises.

Felecia also talks about the innovative learning labs created for Black Ambition entrepreneurs, offering unprecedented access to established corporate giants like LVMH and Chanel. This access includes premium insights into supply chain logistics, strategic planning from top-tier professionals, and mentorship from industry leaders, facilitated by the immense influence of Pharrell.

The discussion underscores an essential ethos: meaningful mentorship goes beyond advice; it requires action and advocacy. For Felecia, the litmus test for effective allies is simple ‚Äì if someone can make a vital connection for themselves, they should be willing to do it for Black entrepreneurs as well.

This episode of EYL with Felecia Hatcher is a must-watch for anyone passionate about entrepreneurship, mentorship, and closing the racial wealth gap. Be inspired by stories of real impact and learn how Black Ambition is paving the way for a new generation of successful Black entrepreneurs.

One Saturday morning, while he is uploading some trash into the dumpster outside of his office building, he is approached by a police officer. The cop questions him about the dumping, and claims that what he is doing is illegal. Mr. Whitfield assures the officer that he is in fact the owner of the business and dumping is obviously allowed on his own property. Nevertheless, the officer detains James and is intent on taking him to the station. Then when Mango Park Police Captain James Porter arrives on the scene, he sees the officer's true intentions and allows Mr. Whitfield to be released.

In this series of Black Excellence in Business, we will be presenting a video series on the historical, monumental, and significant achievements by black business leaders and entrepreneurs over the decades.  Inspired by the web series by Black Enterprise, their ‚ÄúGreat Moments in Black Business‚Äù articles offered a dynamic countdown of major accomplishments and milestones that has had widespread impact not only on the economic development of the Black Community, but the impact on industries across America.  We here at Black Excellist designed our own video series to shine a bright light on the entrepreneurial spirit of African Americans, as we are often only associated with success in sports and entertainment.  We give credit to these companies and business icons, but we also give accolades to the thousands of present-day African American business leaders, entrepreneurs, and bosses who are on the grind *daily* to make an impact on the financial well-being of themselves, their families, and the American culture.

One Saturday morning, while he is uploading some trash into the dumpster outside of his office building, he is approached by a police officer. The cop questions him about the dumping, and claims that what he is doing is illegal. Mr. Whitfield assures the officer that he is in fact the owner of the business and dumping is obviously allowed on his own property. Nevertheless, the officer detains James and is intent on taking him to the station. Then when Mango Park Police Captain James Porter arrives on the scene, he sees the officer's true intentions and allows Mr. Whitfield to be released.

Gaining financial leverage can be a difficult and time-consuming process that is sometimes not worth the effort. Imagine if there was a method to get money without having to carry the burden of debt. That is where grants come in; they are a method for the government to aid you with your business initiative or entrepreneurial efforts. Many people are unaware of grants, and those who are aware are either unsure how to go about finding the perfect one for them or are too afraid to apply. This video will teach you everything you need to know about grants in 2023.

black business,_UD4zc0aOzg,Cop Falsely Arrests Black Business Owner. Then This Happens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UD4zc0aOzg,"James Whitfield is a small business owner in downtown Mango Park. One Saturday morning, while he is uploading some trash into the dumpster outside of his office building, he is approached by a police officer. The cop questions him about the dumping, and claims that what he is doing is illegal. Mr. Whitfield assures the officer that he is in fact the owner of the business and dumping is obviously allowed on his own property. Nevertheless, the officer detains James and is intent on taking him to the station. Then when Mango Park Police Captain James Porter arrives on the scene, he sees the officer's true intentions and allows Mr. Whitfield to be released.

According to the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau‚Äôs first Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, Black business owners are three times as likely as Whites to say they need financing, but choose not to apply for it.

Fifty nine percent of Black business owners say they don‚Äôt apply for loans out of the fear of not being approved. The fear is justified. Only 47 percent of Black business owners get the full amount they requested versus 76 percent of Whites.

Ron Busby, President and CEO of the U.S. Black Chambers, and Michael Grant, President of the National Bankers Association, joined Roland Martin on NewsOne Now to discuss the Black business credit gap and what can be done to close it.

black entrepreneurship,xGkZqPXLwr0,Empowering Entrepreneurs: Black Ambition‚Äôs Funding and Mentorship Strategies,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGkZqPXLwr0,"Welcome to another inspiring episode of EYL, where we shine a spotlight on some of the most impactful and innovative leaders in various industries. In this episode, our host, Rashad Bilal, dives deep into a conversation with Felecia Hatcher, a dynamic leader and the driving force behind Black Ambition.

### About Black Ambition:
Black Ambition is a non-profit organization dedicated to funding and supporting Black and Latinx entrepreneurs. Founded four years ago, the organization offers a unique platform that combines financial investment, mentorship, and holistic wellness support to empower entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams.

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Equity Investment:** Felecia discusses how Black Ambition invests in startups through a streamlined process, taking a consistent equity stake across the board. Investments are facilitated through a safe agreement, offering an 80% discount, ensuring that the maximum benefit goes back into the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

2. **Mentorship and Networking:** One of the standout features of Black Ambition is its extensive mentorship program. Entrepreneurs receive guidance from industry-specific mentors who provide invaluable insights and expertise. The organization also leverages a vast network of wealthy individuals and corporations to help startups secure additional funding.

3. **Financial Support:** Black Ambition operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, primarily funded by foundations and major corporate partners like LVMH, Adidas, Lennar Foundation, and Comcast NBCUniversal. This robust support structure enables the organization to inject capital into promising ventures and drive systemic change.

4. **Holistic Approach to Entrepreneurship:** Felecia highlights the organization's comprehensive approach, which includes access to therapy and mental health support. Entrepreneurs benefit from group wellness sessions and one-on-one counseling, helping them navigate the emotional and psychological challenges of running a business.

5. **Challenges and Successes:** The conversation delves into the highs and lows of the entrepreneurial journey, emphasizing the importance of resilience and mental fortitude. Felecia shares personal anecdotes and lessons learned, providing a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs to follow.

### Notable Quotes:
- **On Mentorship and Networking:** ""We do it through a safe agreement. It's an 80% discount that we do. So it's a very small amount that comes back into Black Ambition so that we can fund more entrepreneurs."" - Felecia Hatcher
- **On Financial Support:** ""Most of our funding comes from foundations and major corporations that are our partners, that support the organization and allow us to do our programming, and then also allow us to be able to invest and inject capital into those companies."" - Felecia Hatcher
- **On Holistic Approach:** ""We have therapists on staff that support our entrepreneurs through a program called Evoke. So the entrepreneurs get group wellness and mental health support."" - Felecia Hatcher

black entrepreneurship,KLIxyxcpJWU,Breaking Barriers: How Felecia Hatcher and Pharrell Williams Support Black &amp; Hispanic Entrepreneurs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIxyxcpJWU,"Welcome to this clip of EYL, where we dive deep into the inspiring stories and groundbreaking initiatives shaping the world of entrepreneurship. In this clip, our hosts Rashad Bilal and Troy Millings sit down with the phenomenal Felecia Hatcher, the dynamic leader behind Black Ambition, a revolutionary initiative founded by Pharrell Williams.

**What is Black Ambition?**
Felecia Hatcher kicks off the discussion by explaining what Black Ambition is all about. Launched four years ago by Pharrell Williams, Black Ambition aims to create uninterrupted opportunities for Black, Hispanic, and HBCU entrepreneurs. The initiative provides funding, community contacts, resources, and support, ensuring that these entrepreneurs can achieve their dreams without the constant interruptions and setbacks typically encountered.

**Inspiration from Lovecraft Country**
Felecia shares a compelling anecdote from her first conversation with Pharrell, inspired by a scene from the HBO show Lovecraft Country. The powerful question posed in the show, ""Who were you uninterrupted?"" becomes a central theme for Black Ambition. The goal is to help entrepreneurs envision and build a future where they can operate without obstacles, constantly moving forward with a green light at every intersection in their journey.

**Uninterrupted Pathways to Success**
The focus of Black Ambition is not only on helping entrepreneurs become better businesspeople but also on reducing the interruptions they face. By aligning all necessary resources and support, Black Ambition aims to provide a clear, unobstructed path to success, enabling entrepreneurs to thrive and scale their businesses efficiently.

**Meeting of the Minds**
Troy Millings inquires about how Felecia and Pharrell aligned their visions and came together. Felecia recounts her journey of co-founding the Center for Black Innovation and building Black Tech Week. Her extensive work in Miami's Black tech ecosystem eventually led Pharrell's chief of staff to invite her to lead Black Ambition. Despite a rocky initial meeting, Felecia's push-back and visionary ideas impressed Pharrell's team, leading to her current role.

**Goals and Achievements**
Rashad Bilal highlights the ambitious goal of raising over $95 million to support 100 entrepreneurs. Felecia elaborates on the structured process of achieving this goal through a prize competition. Each year, Black Ambition identifies 250 entrepreneurs, who then undergo a rigorous three-month mentorship program. From this cohort, around 35 companies receive significant investments. To date, Black Ambition has invested in 101 entrepreneurs, who have collectively raised over $95 million.

**Expert Insights and Advice**
Drawing from her extensive experience with companies like Nintendo, Sony, Target, Disney, and Google, Felecia offers invaluable advice to aspiring entrepreneurs. She emphasizes the importance of not being intimidated by large corporations, noting that agility and quick decision-making are the secret weapons of small businesses.

Join us for this enlightening conversation as we delve into the visionary journey of Felecia Hatcher and learn about the impactful work of Black Ambition. This episode is a must-watch for anyone interested in entrepreneurship, innovation, and creating a more inclusive and supportive ecosystem for underrepresented communities.

In this series of Black Excellence in Business, we will be presenting a video series on the historical, monumental, and significant achievements by black business leaders and entrepreneurs over the decades.  Inspired by the web series by Black Enterprise, their ‚ÄúGreat Moments in Black Business‚Äù articles offered a dynamic countdown of major accomplishments and milestones that has had widespread impact not only on the economic development of the Black Community, but the impact on industries across America.  We here at Black Excellist designed our own video series to shine a bright light on the entrepreneurial spirit of African Americans, as we are often only associated with success in sports and entertainment.  We give credit to these companies and business icons, but we also give accolades to the thousands of present-day African American business leaders, entrepreneurs, and bosses who are on the grind *daily* to make an impact on the financial well-being of themselves, their families, and the American culture.
