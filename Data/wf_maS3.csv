For example, it said that Black people have an average of $2 in savings, but that doesn't seem very possible as that would mean that most people have zero dollars in savings for it to skew that far.  It also said that Black people have an average of zero dollars in something else - I believe it was home equity.  I suppose this makes sense for people who are renting or homeless, but for the average to be that low, it would mean that so many had zero that it trivialized all amounts above zero.  I tried not to let this color my judgment and tried instead to think about the sentiment of the article and the overall statistics, thinking that there must have been some communication error or hidden factor that was not listed.  As for the sentiment, I thought it was sad that there is so much disparity today, even though we're technically in one of the most peaceful times the planet has ever had and made me want to find solutions to the problems we are having.","I think there are lots of different ways of thinking, so it's hard to cluster them into one answer.  Of course most Republicans are not concerned with people of other races, as if they were then they would likely vote Democratic based on morals.  That accounts for a lot of people in the country, but it is slightly balanced by Democrats who tend to live in more mixed race areas and thus gain more of an understanding that people of other races are people as well, and are worthy of care and respect.  Among my family and friends, there are a lot of White people who respect people of other races and feel empathy for them even when they have struggles we can only imagine, but I do occasionally run into people who have rather backwards attitudes and believe that people of other races are inferior and criminals.","Since I am very poor, I don't think I am personally responsible for any economic disparities.  I also always vote Democrat and tell people about the good that Democratic policies will do for things like race relations and environmentalism, so I believe I am making a slight positive push in this regard.","I live in an area with a fairly high crime rate, so most people keep to themselves.  There are definitely some people who end up being racist after seeing the way people in the neighborhood act and generalizing it to all people of their race despite examples to the contrary.  Some people have more open-minded attitudes, but there's not really a safe way to do anything about it in the neighborhood other than voting.","My social circle values it greatly and we have people of many races within our friend circles as we don't even consider it a factor of their worth when meeting a person.  We also vote whenever we get the chance, and we do research to see which candidates have policies that serve the most good for the most people.  When racial issues come up, we listen with open minds and empathy and try to address the issues as best we can, but nothing has much impact compared to ensuring we vote regularly.","Very loosely as people mostly keep to themselves and only associate with their own small circles.  People do try to keep the peace when they can, and part of that is having good relations with people of other relations, and those who vote Democratically are trying to vote for policies that will serve this as well.",40,1,3,2,,1,1,,22,22,two weeks,18,4,,,,,4,

I would also say that even among those who do care a lot and make it a big part of their identity how much they care, many don't actually try to do much to tackle it other than maybe arguing with relatives or people online, and also have a (mis)understanding of racism that makes their efforts to fight it not very successful or even make it worse at times.","I would say moderately so.

Some people here are actively racist (such as displaying racist flags on their houses, like someone a few houses down from me does), but I think most people don't care or view supporting democrat politicians as being powerfully anti-racist (which I can't say I agree with) and that is the extent of their action. I'm sure some argue with people online too and call out people being particularly egregious like saying racial slurs, but I don't think people that say slurs are the biggest side of racism, it's economic issues like the article at the start of the study, and most people do very little about that. ","For ""social circle"" I will take it to mean friends and family, not random people that live near me. Everyone I associate with vocally condemns racism and thinks it's important to understand and combat. Unfortunately, I think most people I know do not combat it in an effective way, and some people do not view it as extremely important, although everyone considers it at least a bit important. I think viewing racism as important and denouncing it is basically necessary to be respected, but taking serious action is orders of magnitude rarer.","In my community (neighborhood, city, etc.) I don't sense this at all.

I think we are only seeing a little change, while at the same time powerful pushback, because those who are the oppressors are being exposed (with social media and cameras) at the same time that our population character is changing with a growth of minorities, and they fear they will lose their power and privilege, which they do not deserve any more than anyone else. Also, more people are listening to the complaints because they are coming from more white people and not just blacks and Latinos, as more and more mixed couples are finding that their children are being victimized. I have been embarrassed by the behavior of white Americans and the history of this country for a long time - the way the English stole the land, decimated the Indians, enslaved the blacks, and their bill of rights gave no rights to anyone except the white wealthy land owning males. All other rights had to be fought for and gained through Amendments. And they still hold all the wealth they stole or made off the backs of veritable slaves, if not outright slaves, in a capitalist country where it takes money to make money, not necessarily hard work, the wealth gap and inequity grows. ","I live in a very progressive area (by Oberlin College), so there is more concern among whites here who are anti-racists than other surrounding towns, but there is still plenty of racist behavior by police and campus security who don't live in town, but work here, and prey on minorities, and many people I know who are family, friends, and neighbors who behave in racist ways who are in complete denial that they are racists, when they clearly demonstrate biases based on their comments and assumptions about black people and immigrants. Their behavior demonstrates incredible ignorance, arrogance, and selfishness, in my opinion. I don't know many white people who will stand up for blacks and defend them. They are few and far between. They are more likely to want to believe Fox News which spins the truth or highlights minority criminals, but ignores white ones. I don't know if it's because these people don't want their imagined elevated status and way of life and what they believe to be shaken to the core, but they are very judgmental of minorities and act as if they are superior, so I often wish they could be forced to switch places and walk a mile in the others' moccasins to learn a lesson, as they don't seem to learn any other way. They have no empathy unless it happens to them.","Not me personally at all. I have had a huge number of black and Puerto Rican friends my entire time growing up, and have a mixed family. I have been involved as an activist since the 1980s signing petitions and running a web site pushing for rights for African Americans more than my black friends, Native Americans and Latinos, and exposing police and prosecutorial misconduct, so I've continuously been standing up and criticizing how minorities are targeted, profiled, falsely imprisoned, have donated often to innocence projects, and published crimes committed by police, and pushed for changes in the law that would hold criminal whites accountable. I even had police park in front of my home day after day for years to try to intimidate me because they knew I was not afraid of them and was publishing their misconduct where they were charged for false arrest, abuse, profiling, etc. I would not remove it, and even if they got it expunged, I kept the information published so their names would be known, and what they did would be known to any future employers. I figure they are ruining minorities lives by targeting them, giving them criminal records, so they can't get job, earn money, have decent housing or afford transportation, so I'm just returning the favor and hoping what goes around will come around and they will get some negative impact from their actions. But when they commit crimes, they need to be fined, charged, imprisoned, off the job permanently, and definitely not able to get another job carrying a gun and badge with authority over people where they can abuse. So, no I don't feel responsible at all. But I am disgusted by the actions of the majority of white people, especially white males, but again there are exceptions, including some men who feel as passionate as I do about the inequity and injustice.","We have some progressive groups of whites, and decent-sized minority population, that are very active and genuinely work toward preventing racism and improving race relations.","Almost none at all. In my older years, my social circle is smaller - mostly family and a few close friends, but it never even comes up, or rarely. They are not the type to have concerns about other people, really of any race. They are very self-absorbed. I like to volunteer, and none of them do. I have to go by myself or find a stranger to join up with if I want to get involved in volunteer projects. Many whites are very unconcerned with others.","A small collective commitment.

To be completely honest it seems like a half-assed idea meant to assuage white guilt while also reassuring that white people don't have to give anything up themselves.

Those on either end of the spectrum are very concerned about racial issues, but for opposite reasons.

As clearly demonstrated by the wage stagnation of the past rhree decades as  well as the use wage insecurity to keep the lower classes in there place. perhaps that should be the focus of a study.","I think there is still concern., but I think if we look at the bigger picture again more concerning is a loss of America. The loss of our ability to go to the store or church or mall or restaurant without the fear of being shot. The loss of living wage jobs , ( and base living wage is in reality $20.00 an hour) Also the loss of connectedness as Americans. 
I see more importance placed on keeping your cultural identitythan on being a good citizen and neighbor.
The loss of the Golden Rule. Consideration for your fellow person. Very Sad","It is not my fault. I can't control what went on in the past. I certainly won't take responsibility for what others chose to do. I can choose to live differently now and control what I can. Again i think race is not really our most pressing issue.

It seems that on many different fronts we have lost ground that we had gained even in the late 1970's.,A lot. More than that it is how we treat each other every time we go out in public.
